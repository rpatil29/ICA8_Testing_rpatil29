# Description

In men's public toilets with urinals, there is this unwritten rule that you leave at least one urinal free between you and the next person peeing. For example, if there are 3 urinals and one person is already peeing in the left one, you will choose the urinal on the right and not the one in the middle. That means that a maximum of 3 people can pee at the same time on public toilets with 5 urinals when following this rule (Only 2 if the first-person pees into urinal 2 or 4). 

# Code

1. The Urinals.java file contains function to calculate the number of urinals that are empty, following the "Unwritten Rule"

2. UrinalsTest.java file contains main function which executes the Urinals.java file

3. test.java file contains the jUnit test cases written for executing the function in Urinals.java
